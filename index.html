  <p2>My name is Ariana Ahmadi, I am 16 years old and I live in Ottawa, Ontario. My father and my mother is of Afghan origin and have both studied here in Canada. My mother has finished busniess and my dad has obtained his masters in civil engineering. I have 5 younger brothers and no other sister.<br>
<br>
I'm still in 11th grade but when I grow up, I'd like to study aerospace engineering. Before, heading off to the University of Toronto to complete my masters program, my parents have suggested to complete my undergraduate here, at Carlton University. After having many years of experience and interships form the aerospace indurstry, I'd like to work for big companies such as NASA, CSA, or SpaceX. Who knows, maybe I'll open my own buisness somedays, I'v already palnned one with a few friends called SSA accronym for Science Space Agency.(SIMOUNE LINK REPLIT) for With all of the space travels that I'll incounter in the future, travelling the earth has always been intersting. I got hooked on travel from a very young age: I was four years old when my mother took me to Afghanistan to visit my family. I have been there for four months. I have also traveled with my family to the United States and other cities in Canada such as Toronto and Montreal. Of course, the trips were all great but the one that was unforgetful was my trip to Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
Througout the blog, I'll speak on my experince visiting Afghanistan. I was young when I last visited Afghanistan, yet it feels like it was just yesterday. Come along, I'll take you on a trip!<br></p2>

      The Sting of Tongues<br> </p>
    
    <img src="https://omniglot.com/images/writing/persian.gif" class="floatLeft">
    <p2>You guessed it: I am English speaking. I was borned in Canada which allowed me to develop a strong understanding of English and French as I was mostly raised with these two langagues which allowed me to develop a western and french accent. Since I'm middle eastern/ Asian, I speak my motherly langrague which is Farsi (a form of Persian). This allowed me to develop an understanding of Iranian since they are similar, yet can have major differences with accents and words. I can speak a little Pashto which is a langague in Afghanistan yet I'm not too good. My mother's frist tongue is Pashto, yet she also speaks Farsi. I'm a muslim, our holy book is written in Arabic. From a young age, I had to develop an understanding of reading in arabic. I can now read arabic, yet I don't comprehend the words which is a desadvantage because I have to read the Quran in the Arabic/English translator. I would say that English is my second language, yet I speaks English more fluently then my motherly thongue Farsi since I live in a westernized countury, so I conider it as my first langague. Visiting Afghanistan had a major struggle, the langague. I was surranged with all of my relatives who spoke fluent Farsi and Pashto where as I, can speak little Pashto, yet my Fasi is great but slightly on the "weak" side. You see, in every langague, there's words to sound polite, or casual. I'm not too good with the polite side as I speak casual Farsi, which sometimes doesn't sound nice when surrounded with Persian speaking relatives. This was a great disadvantage because if a non Farsi speaking tourist was to visit Afgahnistan, it would be a great struggle to get a point crossed or complete simple tasks. Farsi is a langague I can speaks but once I began to develop an understanding for other langagues, I don't always find it easy.<br></p2>

    <p>The Sight</p>

    <p2> What was my first destination in Afghanistan? Kabul, Afghanistan. I love nature, wild corners, stimulating encounters and I will find it all there. Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan and a place where its violent war cannot reach. My parent's own ground in the area, and the vast magority was greenery which I loved. We then headed off to Bamyan. It is originally a location famous for it's Buddha enormous mountine ingraved statue to which has its own history if you click the photo. The magority of Afganistan is mountines. There are roads within the mountins where rivers flow underneath, it is quite the view. The rides were bumpy and scary but if put into oerspective, it was an advantage. I was able to the a country of war at a different view where birds flew high and the sky was blue. Well, war scares me a little, I admit, but it's part of the adventure, isn't it?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Did you make it to the end of the trip with me? I hope my experince might shed some light in a country where light doesn't seem to exist. It truly is a beautiful country in areas where violence isn't the poison. I would visit there anytime, will you come with me again?
