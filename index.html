  <p2><br>My name is Ariana Ahmadi, I am 16 years old and I live in Ottawa, Ontario. My father and my mother are of Afghan descent and have both studied here in Canada. My mother has finished business and my father has obtained his masters in civil engineering. I have 5 younger brothers without any other sisters.<br>
<br>
 I'm still in 11th grade but when I grow up, I'd like to study aerospace engineering. Before I head off to the University of Toronto to complete my masters program, my parents suggested that I complete my undergraduate here at Carleton University. After having many years of experience and internships in the aerospace industry, I would like to work for large companies such as NASA, CSA, or SpaceX. Who knows, maybe I'll open my own business one day, I already have one planned with a few friends called SSA, acronym for Science Space Agency from which you can get more information on <a class="here" href="https://rst-ssa.itssimoune.repl.co/">here</a>. With all the space travel that I will encounter in the future, traveling on Earth has always been interesting. I got hooked on travel from a very young age: I was four years old when my mother took me to Afghanistan to visit my family. I was there for four months. I have also traveled with my family to the United States and to other cities in Canada such as Toronto and Montreal. Of course, the trips have all been great, but the one that has not been forgotten was my trip to Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
Throughout the blog, I will be talking about my experience visiting Afghanistan. I was young when I last visited Afghanistan, yet it feels like it was yesterday. Come along, I'll take you on a trip!<br></p2>

      The Sting of Tongues<br> </p>

    <p2>Farsi is a language I can speak but once I begin to develop an understanding for other languages, I don't always find it easy. You guessed it: I am English speaking. I was borned in Canada which allowed me to develop a strong understanding of English and French. As I am from the Middle East/ Asia, I speak my native language which is Farsi (a form of Persian). It allowed me to develop an understanding of Iranian as they are similar but can have major differences with accents and words. I can speak a little Pashto which is an Afghan language, yet I'm not too good. My mother's first tongue is Pashto, but she also speaks Farsi. I am a Muslim, our holy book is written in Arabic. From an early age, I had to develop an understanding of Arabic text. I can read Arabic, yet I canâ€™t comprehend the words that I speak, which is a disadvantage because I have to read the Quran in the Arabic/English translator. I speak English more fluently than my native tongue, Farsi, since I was born and raised in a Westernized country.<br> 
    <br>
    Visiting Afghanistan had a major struggle, the language. I was surrounded by all of my relatives who spoke Farsi and Pashto fluently, whereas I can speak little Pashto, yet my Fasi is great but slightly on the "weak" side. In every language, there are words to sound polite or casual. I'm not too good with the polite side of Farsi as I speak more casually, which sometimes doesn't sound nice when surrounded by Persian-speaking relatives. This was a big inconvenience because if a non-Farsi speaking tourist were to visit Afghanistan, it would be a big struggle to get past a point or complete simple tasks. For someone who is able to speak the tongue of Afghans, I feel a string in my vocabulary and communication because of how many languages I practice and begin to forget others, which then becomes an inconvenience when I visit a country where most people speak Farsi and Pashto.<br></p2>

    <p>The Sight</p>
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bamiyan"><img src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/news_2253-890-520-20210311100310.jpg" class="floatRight"></a>
    <p2>What was my first destination in Afghanistan? Kabul, Afghanistan. I love nature, wild corners, stimulating encounters and I found it all there. Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan and a place where its violent war cannot reach. My parents own land in the region, and the vast majority was the greenery I loved. We then headed off to Bamyan. It is originally a location famous for its Buddha statue carved into the mountain which has its own story. You may read its history once you have clicked on the photo. The majority of Afghanistan is mountains. There are roads in the mountains where rivers flow below, it is quite the view. The rides were bumpy and scary, but if put into perspective, it was an advantage. I was able to see a country of war from a different view where the birds were flying high and the sky was blue. Well, the war scares me a little, I admit, but it's part of the adventure, isn't it?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Did you make it to the end of the trip with me? I hope my experince might shed some light in a country where light doesn't seem to exist. It truly is a beautiful country in areas where violence isn't the poison. I would visit there anytime, will you come with me again?<br>
